## Introduction

**We are two students** who developed the Dental Expert app to digitize the patient record management process for a dentist. Our app is designed to streamline the dentist's workflow by allowing the addition of patient records through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or speech-to-text options, or manually typing the information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users' personal data.

We may also collect data automatically through the use of cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve our Service.

### How We Use This Data

- Enable the digitization of patient records through OCR or speech-to-text features.

Introduction
We are two students who developed the Dental Expert app to digitize the patient record management process for a dentist. Our app is designed to streamline the dentist's workflow by allowing the addition of patient records through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or speech-to-text options, or manually typing the information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users' personal data.

We may also collect data automatically through the use of cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve our Service.

How We Use This Data
We use the data we collect to improve user experience, analyze data, identify usage trends, improve our service, and monitor and prevent misuse of our service. Specifically, we use the data to:

Enable the digitization of patient records through OCR or speech-to-text features.
Facilitate communication between the dentist and the patients.
Improve the functionality and usability of our Service.
Security of Data
The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or wireless network, and no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
